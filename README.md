# KikiMeter
## ToDo
- add buttons on top to reset/pause every table with one click
- always show self if not in shown bars (either on top or bottom with placement)

## State
- accuracy of values displayed need further testing
- max players tested so far: 2

## Description
Only works when in a raid or party!  
parses your damage and healing done from the combat log and broadcasts values to other players, eliminating
the issue of inaccuracies caused by players being out of range
